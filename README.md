# NetflixApp with MERN üé•üçø
I developed this full-stack project as part of my journey to enhance my skills in web development. The Netflix-Clone is a fully functional streaming platform, built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). This project allowed me to explore key concepts in full-stack development, integrating both front-end and back-end technologies.

Key Features:
- User Authentication: Users can easily register and log in to their accounts.
- Trailer and Movie Details: Browse through a rich library of movies and TV shows, and view detailed information such as trailers, ratings, and descriptions.
- Search and Filter: Search for your favorite content, whether it's movies or TV shows, with a seamless search functionality.
- Similar Content Recommendations: Get personalized recommendations for similar movies or TV shows based on your choices.
- Responsive Design: The app is fully responsive, providing a smooth experience across different devices.

By working on this project, I gained in-depth experience with:

- MongoDB for efficient data storage and retrieval.
- Express.js to create the backend API.
- React for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
- Node.js for handling server-side logic.
This Netflix-clone project helped me significantly improve my understanding of how to integrate front-end and back-end technologies, API handling, and working with databases.

Hope to see you again in new projects.
